# How I got into programming through QA

    Sidenote: Even though this article might now be the best source of learning materials, I hope that my story will give you some encouragement to go for what you want. Regardless of whether it's becoming a developer or improving yourself as a QA.

Earlier this year, I made a crazy decision to change my career path. I became a manual tester after a few years of work in the biotech industry, with only a will to learn. Now it is a few months later and I'm solving algorithm problems, learning about data structure, and thinking about what should I do for a programming side project.

How did I end up here? Here are some steps I took along the way:

## Becoming manual QA

When I started working as a manual QA, a had very little knowledge about programming. A ton of new terminology hit me in the face right away: `git`, `OAS`, `docker`, `HTTP` - Aaah! Seems funny to me now, but at the time, I was genuinely terrified of how much I needed to learn.

With that in my head, my first milestone was to understand how the application that I would be testing, works. Even though it does not sound like a big deal, I gained a lot of confidence to look for new challenges afterward. Even more, because the product is not intended for a standard user, but allows to design APIs.

That was the first two weeks. Finding myself in a completely new world, trying to find anything even remotely familiar to me.

```
TAKEAWAY: you don't know anything at the beginning and it's okay.
```

## Next step: being more independent

A month passed and with it some big changes: my first regression testing suite for a release, reporting bugs, and being as an owner of manual testing the PRs (with other team members focusing on automation and supporting me whenever needed).

At that point, I managed to grasp the basic concepts of the tools we were using: `docker`, `yarn`, `TestRail`. My understanding of the product components was at a decent level - even though I did not know all them, at least I was aware of how to search/ask for an explanation. I also learned about `VCS`, got more confident with the CLI, and gained maybe the most important of all skills - using the documentation :D

And even though it felt like I was going in the right direction I knew that without increasing my overall IT knowledge, at some point I would face a wall that I could not jump over. So I started digging more. That was a moment I faced my first blocker: myself.

Imposter syndrome is a real thing, and I was not an exception. It took some time to get rid of, and I am probably still not 100% over it, but understanding that I don't need to know everything and figure out all of it by myself was one of the most valuable lessons I learned. Especially that, the feedback I was getting from my coworkers, was nothing but supportive and encouraging.

```
TAKEAWAY: Be proud of your achievements, ask others for help when you need it, give yourself some time to grow - it won't happen overnight
```

## Automating E2E

 So I feel somewhat confident about manual testing, everything is going fine, and then... surprise!

 _- You'll be writing e2e tests now Michael!_

Here comes another life lesson: stuff changes. Even more frequent if you work in a startup. That's a thing you'll need to deal with: adapt and learn fast. A completely different approach than the one I was used to in biotech - if you wanted to be proficient in one area, you needed to spend an extreme amount of time and the basics of it were not changing that often.

But coming back to automation: the framework we were using at the time was CodeceptJS. I'll skip the period in which I was learning it, because of two reasons:

- I only wrote 1 or 2 tests in it before [we switched to Cypress](https://11sigma.com/blog/2019-05-08--core-cypress-lessons-we-learned-that-10x-ed-our-automation0)
- At the time that I began reading about stuff that allowed me to develop even more: JavaScript.

Writing e2e tests was an awesome way to learn about programming. It required a few different things from the start:

1. Being familiar with CSS
2. Learning about the framework used for testing
3. Understanding more about HTML

Acquiring these skills allowed me to write some simple tests. Because we were in the middle of building a new product at the moment, there were some basic functionalities to cover, like filling the account information - a great playground for a newbie. In the meantime, I was reading [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net), [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/pl/docs/Web/JavaScript), and consuming a lot of YouTube videos about programming - not only to learn about the technicalities but also to be more aware of the possible directions of my future growth.

This was a turning point.

```
TAKEAWAY: if you feel like it's too early to make the next step in your career - overcome that feeling. I learned how to start writing e2e tests along the way, and got another profit out of it: things I considered hard during "manual QA" phase - suddenly became much easier
```

## Programming phase - `in progress...`

Object-oriented programming, design patterns, abstractions, data structures... - this is my life now. Trying to learn something new everyday but being in peace with knowing that it won't happen in a day, week, or even a few months. Understanding that my path does not need to be perfect, but has to be fun to keep me motivated.

The first major boost happened when I started learning JS - using loops, wrapping functions, understanding abstractions, using different data structures to solve problems, classes... Whenever I learn something new, I try to implement it in the stuff I'm currently working on. Sometimes it might not meet the best practices pattern, but hey - at least some practice comes out of it.

The second thing was switching to Cypress - all of us were getting to know it from the beginner level (of course with different previous job experiences but still). Once again - knowing how asynchronous functions work, figuring out Promises - allowed me to speed up learning this framework (which I'm still in the process of).

Another thing that happened during that time, was that I gave a short presentation about best practices in using Cypress - it was extremely stressful (speaking to MUCH smarter people than me) but in the end, it made me understand the topic even more.

Third, and the latest boost happened after I started searching for information about data structures and algorithms. Focusing on solving problems rather than creating ideas for scripts from the ground up, definitely made my coding more efficient and to the point. This is what I'm currently focusing on - not only writing code but doing it in the proper, clean, and optimized way.

```
TAKEAWAY: learn fast and ask questions. Practice makes perfect, and you'll get there at some point
```

## What's next

The process of learning does not only allow me to understand my job better - I feel like I'm more focused, can filter out non-essential information (regardless of whether I'm deciding on the e2e test scope, reading a chapter in a book or thinking about what to share in this article). Writing tests and reviewing PRs became much easier - I have a deeper understanding of code and greater confidence in my judgments.

Right now my next milestone is to be even more involved in the product - writing my first feature would be awesome.

There where definitely some mistakes I made along the way, that you should avoid:

- **I started asking others for help too late:** so much time wasted! Don't try to understand everything by yourself - there are already more experienced people that could give you some advice

- **Was afraid to practice:** I thought that I needed to finish a book/article/whatever and to use the information I gained from it. That's bullshit - learn both by reading and by practice. It will stick with you better.

- **I was too hard on myself:** if you are an intern/junior level or doing manual QA - believe me that doing anything that's above your job title will give you nothing but positive feedback.

And that's it! I hope my story gives you some encouragement to pursue a programming career if you are not 100% convinced that you can do it - I changed my career path at age 27 and it feels awesome. And if what I wrote still did not convince you, let me say one thing - community in this industry is awesome. I would not achieve all of this if it would not be for my workmates at Stoplight and all of the motivation and advice they gave me - I bow to you!
